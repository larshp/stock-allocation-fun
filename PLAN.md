make a stock allocation solution in ABAP, add one feature at a time, keep improving it. It must integrate into existing SAP system and follow best practices for ABAP development.

use abaplint and transpiler for testing, record bugs and issues in ANOMALIES.md

open-abap does not include the business logic needed, add SAP standard stubs in a separate directory and include it in linting and transpiling. This includes stuff like reading stock and writing stock, reading and writing orders, etc via SAP standard APIs. Eg. database table MARC carries available stock, add it to the stubs for reading stock. All custom code starting with Z must be in the src folder.

keep your notes and progrss in NOTES.md
